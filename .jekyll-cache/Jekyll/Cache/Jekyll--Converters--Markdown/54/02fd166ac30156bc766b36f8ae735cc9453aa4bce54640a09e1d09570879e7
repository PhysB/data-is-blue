I"V<p><strong>Who this is blog post for</strong>: Knowledge workers, people who work in offices, students, writers, introverts of all stripes.</p>

<p>Technology seems to attract the self-quantifying, self-improvement type and I have to admit, as a data scientist at a tech company, I fall squarely into that demographic. There is so much advice given about how to work smarter, work better, be more efficient, or more productive. Most of that advice ultimately falls short because it fails to account for the simple fact that people are different. What works for me is unlikely to work for you.</p>
