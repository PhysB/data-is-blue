I"É<p>I have a new project at work that means that I get to dive into a new field - natural language processing. My boss and coworkers suggested a few papers for me to read to lay a foundation, and Iâ€™m going to write up each one as I go through it. This is, frankly, way more helpful for me than to anyone who might be reading this. However, if you were ever curious about how a physicist interprets and understands natural language processing, well, hereâ€™s your look inside my brain.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m starting with one of the absolute classic papers in the field: <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf">â€œDistributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality.â€</a> This is the original Google word2vec paper that blew everyoneâ€™s minds with the ability to add and subtract words in a meaningful way. E.g. â€œking-male+female = queen.â€ Letâ€™s dive in.</p>
